Advanced Python – CIST-004B
Dual Enrollment Coursework Portfolio
This repository contains all programming assignments, labs, and analytical exercises completed for CIST-004B: Advanced Python Programming through dual enrollment.
The work in this repository emphasizes algorithmic efficiency, abstraction, structured program design, and performance analysis using Python.
Course Focus
CIST-004B builds beyond introductory programming and concentrates on:
Algorithm design and implementation
Time complexity analysis (Big-O notation)
Iterative vs recursive problem solving
Data structure manipulation
Performance benchmarking
Code organization and modularity
Assignments prioritize correctness, efficiency, and clarity over surface-level functionality.
